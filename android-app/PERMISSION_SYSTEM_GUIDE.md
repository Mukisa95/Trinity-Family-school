## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **App Launch Sequence**
1. **App Starts** → App loads immediately
2. **Check Notifications** → Only request notifications permission if not granted
3. **Load Web App** → Continue to main app regardless of permission status

### **Permission Request Flow**
1. **Show Explanation** → Clear dialog explaining why permission is needed
2. **User Choice** → "Grant Permission" or "Not Now"
3. **System Dialog** → Android's standard permission request
4. **Handle Result** → Show success/denial message
5. **Settings Option** → If permanently denied, offer settings access

### **Settings Integration**
- **Permission Status Dialog** → Shows current state of all permissions
- **Open Settings Button** → Takes user directly to app settings
- **Return Detection** → Checks permissions again after settings visit

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **PermissionManager Class**
```kotlin
// Automatic initialization
permissionManager.initialize(
    onPermissionGranted = { permission ->
        // Handle granted permission
    },
    onPermissionDenied = { permission ->
        // Handle denied permission  
    },
    onAllPermissionsGranted = {
        // All permissions ready
    }
)
```

### **Permission Constants**
- `PERMISSION_NOTIFICATIONS` → POST_NOTIFICATIONS (Android 13+)
- `PERMISSION_CAMERA` → CAMERA access

### **Smart Detection**
- **Android Version Aware** → Handles different Android versions correctly
