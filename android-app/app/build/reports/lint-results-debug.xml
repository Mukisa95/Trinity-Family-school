        id="ScopedStorage"
        severity="Warning"
        message="READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is deprecated (and is not granted) when targeting Android 13+. If you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media files on the shared storage, you should instead use one or more new storage permissions: `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` or `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`."

        summary="Affected by scoped storage"
        explanation="Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using `requestLegacyExternalStorage`). In particular, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` will no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent of `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` instead.&#xA;&#xA;As of Android 13, if you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media files on the shared storage, you should be using instead one or more new storage permissions:&#xA;* `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`&#xA;* `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`&#xA;* `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`&#xA;&#xA;and then add `maxSdkVersion=&quot;33&quot;` to the older permission. See the developer guide for how to do this: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13#granular-media-permissions&#xA;&#xA;The `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission can be used to manage all files, but it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.&#xA;&#xA;To learn more, read these resources: Play policy: https://goo.gle/policy-storage-help Allowable use cases: https://goo.gle/policy-storage-usecases"

        category="Correctness"

        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html as well as follow this guide:&#xA;https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.html"

        summary="Monochrome icon is not defined"
        explanation="If `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` are both in your manifest, you must either remove the reference to `android:roundIcon` if it is not needed; or, supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` attribute.&#xA;&#xA;For example, if `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` are both in the manifest, a launcher might choose to use `android:roundIcon` over `android:icon` to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also specified in `android:roundIcon`."

        explanation="When calling `TextView#setText`&#xA;* Never call `Number#toString()` to format numbers; it will not handle fraction separators and locale-specific digits properly. Consider using `String#format` with proper format specifications (`%d` or `%f`) instead.&#xA;* Do not pass a string literal (e.g. &quot;Hello&quot;) to display text. Hardcoded text can not be properly translated to other languages. Consider using Android resource strings instead.&#xA;* Do not build messages by concatenating text chunks. Such messages can not be properly translated."
