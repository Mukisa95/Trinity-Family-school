## Overview

This guide covers the complete setup for the exam results integration feature that allows administrators to securely release exam results to parents through the parent dashboard.

- **Release Audit Trail**: Track who released results and when
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Lock/unlock icons showing release status

### Phase 2: Parent Dashboard Integration
- **Results Navigation**: Trophy icon tab in parent dashboard
- **Year/Term Filtering**: Dynamic filtering by academic year and term
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Performance metrics and trends
- **Subject Analysis**: Strong subjects and areas needing improvement
- **Mobile Responsive**: Beautiful UI optimized for all devices
- **Expandable Details**: Subject-wise breakdowns with grades

## Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Exam Results Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_RESULTS_RELEASE=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_RESULTS_RELEASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD_REQUIRED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_RESULTS_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true

# Admin Configuration (Optional - for enhanced security)
ADMIN_PASSWORD_SALT="your-custom-salt-here"
RESULTS_RELEASE_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=90

# Firebase Configuration (ensure these are set)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

## Database Security Rules

Update your Firebase Firestore security rules to include the following:

```javascript
// Add to your existing firestore.rules file

// Results Release Rules
match /resultReleases/{releaseId} {
  // Only authenticated users can read release info
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Only staff with proper permissions can create/update releases
  allow write: if request.auth != null && 
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.permissions.exams == 'full_access';
}

// Enhanced Exam Results Rules
match /examResults/{resultId} {
  // Staff can read all results
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'staff';
  
  // Parents can only read released results for their child
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    resource.data.isReleasedToParents == true &&
    resource.data.pupilId in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.linkedPupils;
  
  // Only staff with exam permissions can write
  allow write: if request.auth != null && 
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.permissions.exams in ['edit', 'full_access'];
}

// Parent Access Rules
match /pupils/{pupilId} {
  // Parents can read basic info for their linked pupils
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    (resource.id in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.linkedPupils ||
     get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'staff');
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Results Not Appearing in Parent Dashboard
**Symptoms**: Parent sees "No Released Results" despite admin releasing them
**Solutions**:
- Verify the user is linked to the correct pupil
- Check Firebase security rules are deployed
- Ensure `isReleasedToParents` is set to `true` in the exam result document
- Verify the parent user has the pupil ID in their `linkedPupils` array

#### 2. Admin Password Modal Not Working
**Symptoms**: Modal doesn't open or password verification fails
**Solutions**:
- Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_RESULTS_RELEASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD_REQUIRED=true`
- Verify the admin user has proper permissions
- Ensure the ModernDialogContent has the `open` prop passed correctly
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### 3. Date Display Issues
**Symptoms**: Dates showing as "Invalid Date" or wrong dates
**Solutions**:
- Ensure exam results have properly formatted date strings
- Verify date-utils functions are imported correctly
- Check that `examDate` field exists in the database
- Use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for consistency

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check Firebase connection
npm run test-firebase

# Verify security rules
firebase firestore:rules:test

# Check data structure
npm run debug-exam-results

# Test parent dashboard
npm run test-parent-dashboard
```
