# Banking and Loan Integration System

## Overview
The banking system has been enhanced to fully integrate loans with account balances, creating a seamless financial management system for pupils.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Integrated Loan Disbursement
- When a loan is created, the loan amount is **automatically added** to the pupil's account balance
- A `LOAN_DISBURSEMENT` transaction is recorded for audit purposes
- Pupils can immediately use the loan funds for withdrawals

### 2. Automatic Loan Repayment on Deposits
- When a pupil makes a deposit, the system **automatically prioritizes loan repayment**
- Deposits first pay off outstanding loans (oldest loans first)
- Any remaining amount after loan repayment is added to the account balance
- Multiple transactions are created to track both loan repayments and balance additions

### 3. Overdue Loan Collection
- The system can automatically collect money from account balances for overdue loans
- `processOverdueLoans(pupilId)` - Process overdue loans for a specific pupil
- `processAllOverdueLoans()` - Process overdue loans for all pupils system-wide

### 4. Enhanced Account Information
- `getAllAccountsWithPupils()` now includes:
  - Active loans for each account
  - Total outstanding loan amount
  - Available balance (account balance minus outstanding loans)

### 5. Account Summary
- `getAccountSummary(pupilId)` provides comprehensive financial overview:
  - Account details
  - All active loans
  - Total loan amounts
  - Total outstanding amounts
  - Available balance for withdrawals
