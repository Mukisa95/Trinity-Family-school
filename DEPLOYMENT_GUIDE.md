# Deployment Guide - Updated Cloudinary Configuration

## Overview
This guide covers deploying the updated application with Cloudinary photo management to both:
1. **Production Project**: `trinity-production` (trinityschoolganda.vercel.app)
2. **Dev Project**: `trinityfamilyschool` (trinityfamilyschool.vercel.app)

---

## Step 1: Update Environment Variables

### A. Production Project (`trinity-production`)

The production project already has the correct Cloudinary credentials. Add the folder variable:

```bash
# Navigate to: https://vercel.com/your-account/trinity-production/settings/environment-variables

# Add new variable:
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=production
```

### B. Dev Project (`trinityfamilyschool`)

Update ALL Cloudinary credentials to the new account:

```bash
# Navigate to: https://vercel.com/your-account/trinityfamilyschool/settings/environment-variables

# Update/Add these variables:
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dblhnelcn
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=642821213322829
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=Y7oeDIVhQFd8wQXrgDbE1wSb5no
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=development
```

**Important**: 
- Make sure to check all three environments: Production, Preview, Development
- The old credentials won't work with the new Cloudinary account

---

## Step 2: Update Local Development

Add the folder variable to your `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=development
```

---

## Step 3: Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add environment-specific Cloudinary folders"
git push origin main
```

---

## Step 4: Deploy to Both Projects

### Deploy to Production (`trinity-production`)

```bash
# Link to production project
vercel link --project trinity-production --yes

# Deploy
vercel --prod --yes
```

### Deploy to Dev (`trinityfamilyschool`)

```bash
# Link to dev project
vercel link --project trinityfamilyschool --yes

# Deploy
vercel --prod --yes
```

---

## Cloudinary Folder Structure

After deployment, uploads will be organized as follows:

```
Cloudinary Account (dblhnelcn)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ school-photos/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facilities/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staff/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ other/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ development/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ school-photos/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facilities/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staff/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ other/
```

This keeps production and development photos completely separate!

---

## Verification

After deployment, test photo upload on both environments:
1. **Production**: https://trinityschoolganda.vercel.app/admin/photos
2. **Dev**: https://trinityfamilyschool.vercel.app/admin/photos

Check the console logs to confirm the correct folder is being used:
```
üìÅ Cloudinary folder: production/school-photos/events
```

---

## Compression Features

All uploads now include:
- **Max dimensions**: 1920x1920px
- **Quality**: auto:eco (balanced)
- **Format**: Auto-select (WebP, AVIF)
- **Expected size**: 300-800KB for most photos (well under 500KB target)

---

## Notes

- Pupil profile photos still use Firebase Storage (not Cloudinary)
- Only Photos Management component uses Cloudinary
- Compression is automatic and happens on upload
- Both environments share the same Cloudinary account but use different folders
