## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Do NOT mix keys** between environments
2. **DEV keys** = `trinityfamilyschool` project only
3. **PRODUCTION keys** = `trinity-school-ganda` project only
4. Both sets of keys were generated on: **2025-10-26**
5. These keys are valid URL-safe base64 and fix the previous encoding error

---

## üîí Security

- ‚úÖ **Separate keys** provide better security isolation
- ‚úÖ If DEV keys are compromised, PRODUCTION is safe
- ‚úÖ Can rotate keys independently per environment
- ‚úÖ Push notifications won't cross environments
- ‚ùå **Never commit** these keys to Git (they're in `.gitignore`)

---

## üß™ Testing

After adding keys to Vercel:

1. **Wait for deployment** to complete
2. Visit your deployed site
3. Go to: `/notifications` page
4. Click **"Enable Push Notifications"**
5. Grant browser permission
6. Send a test notification
7. ‚úÖ Should work perfectly!
