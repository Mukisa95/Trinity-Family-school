## Known Limitations

1. **Historical Data**: Currently uses mock data for trends (enrollment over time)
   - Solution: Implement data snapshots/historical tracking in database

2. **PDF Export**: Placeholder implementation
   - Solution: Integrate library like jsPDF or PDFKit

3. **Real-time Updates**: Data refreshes on page load
   - Solution: Implement real-time data subscriptions

4. **Large Datasets**: May slow down with 1000+ pupils
   - Solution: Implement pagination or data aggregation

## Support & Maintenance

### Regular Updates Needed
- Add new chart types as requirements evolve
- Update color schemes if branding changes
- Add new data sources as features added
- Optimize performance for growing datasets

### Monitoring
- Track page load times
- Monitor chart rendering performance
