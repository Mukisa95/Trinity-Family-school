  - `isMarked` field for DutyRota to indicate academic period duties
  - Academic year and term integration
  - Automatic date setting for marked duty rotas

### 2. Service Layer (`src/lib/services/duty-service.service.ts`)
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete CRUD for all entities
- **Data Transformation**: Timestamp handling and undefined value filtering
- **Query Optimization**: Client-side sorting to avoid complex Firebase indexes
- **Academic Integration**: Support for academic year and term-based filtering

### 3. React Query Hooks (`src/lib/hooks/use-duty-service.ts`)
- **Data Fetching**: Hooks for all entities with proper caching
- **Mutations**: Create, update, delete operations with optimistic updates
- **Digital Signature Integration**: Audit trails for all operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### 4. Main Component (`src/app/duty-service/page.tsx`)
- **Tabbed Interface**: Six main divisions (Overview, Prefectoral, Duty Management, Assessment, Operations, Collage)
- **Permission Integration**: Granular access control using ActionGuard
- **Member Name Resolution**: Dynamic lookup of staff and pupil names
- **Academic Year Context**: Integration with active academic year and terms

### 5. Modal Components
- **CreatePrefectoralPostModal**: Leadership position creation
- **CreateDutyRotaModal**: Duty schedule creation with academic integration
- **CreatePollModal**: Voting system creation
- **AssignMemberModal**: Member assignment with dynamic member selection
