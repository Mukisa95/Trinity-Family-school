## ✅ Solution: Setup Academic Years

### Step 1: Check if Academic Years Exist

1. Navigate to: **`/academic-years`**
2. Check if you have any academic years listed
3. Check if any year is marked as "Active"

### Step 2: Create Academic Year (if missing)

If you don't have any academic years:

1. Go to `/academic-years`
2. Click **"Add Academic Year"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Year**: 2025
   - **Start Date**: January 1, 2025
   - **End Date**: December 31, 2025
   - **Mark as Active**: ✅ Check this box
4. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Add Terms to the Year

After creating the year, add terms:

1. Click on the year you just created
2. Add **Term 1**:
   - Name: Term 1
   - ID: t1-2025
   - Start Date: Jan 1, 2025
   - End Date: Apr 15, 2025

2. Add **Term 2**:
   - Name: Term 2
   - ID: t2-2025
   - Start Date: Apr 16, 2025
   - End Date: Aug 15, 2025

3. Add **Term 3**:
   - Name: Term 3
   - ID: t3-2025
   - Start Date: Sep 1, 2025
   - End Date: Dec 15, 2025

4. Set **Current Term**: Select which term you're currently in (e.g., Term 3)

### Step 4: Refresh Collection Analytics

1. Navigate back to `/fees/analytics`
2. Hard refresh: **Ctrl + Shift + R**
3. The page should now load with data!

## 🔧 Alternative: Use Existing Academic Year

If you already have academic years but analytics still doesn't work:

### Check Configuration

1. Go to `/academic-years`
2. Find your current year (e.g., 2025)
3. Ensure it has:
   - ✅ `isActive` is true
   - ✅ `currentTermId` is set
   - ✅ Terms are properly configured with start/end dates

### Verify Term Structure

Each term must have:
```json
{
  "id": "t3-2025",
  "name": "Term 3",
  "startDate": "2025-09-01",
  "endDate": "2025-12-15"
}
```

## 🚀 Once Academic Years Are Set Up

The analytics page will:

### Automatically
1. **Detect** the active academic year
2. **Select** the current term
3. **Load** all collection data
4. **Calculate** statistics
5. **Display** beautiful analytics

### Manual Selection
You can also manually select:
- Different academic years (2024, 2025, etc.)
