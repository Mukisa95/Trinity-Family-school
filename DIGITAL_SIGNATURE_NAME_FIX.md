# Digital Signature Name Display Fix

## Issue
Digital signatures were showing usernames (like "johndoe" or "mary_smith") instead of actual staff member names (like "John Doe" or "Mary Smith"), making them hard to understand.

## Solution
Updated the digital signature service to use full names instead of usernames for better readability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Digital Signature Service
**File:** `src/lib/services/digital-signature.service.ts`
**Line 38:** Changed from:
```typescript
userName: user.username,
```
To:
```typescript
userName: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`.trim() || user.username,
```

### 2. Updated Procurement Components
**File:** `src/components/procurement/PurchaseManagement.tsx`
**Lines 252 & 320:** Updated to use full names instead of usernames for consistency.

### 3. Updated Test Components
**File:** `src/app/test-signatures/page.tsx`
**Line 93:** Updated test signature creation to use full names.

## How It Works

### Before the Fix:
```
üõ°Ô∏è Collected by johndoe ‚Ä¢ Mar 15, 2024 14:30
```

### After the Fix:
```
üõ°Ô∏è Collected by John Doe ‚Ä¢ Mar 15, 2024 14:30
```

## Fallback Logic
If a user doesn't have `firstName` and `lastName` set, the system falls back to using the `username` to ensure signatures always display something meaningful.

```typescript
userName: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`.trim() || user.username
```

## Impact
- **Fee Collection**: Payment signatures now show staff member names
- **Requirements**: Assignment/collection signatures show clear names
- **Uniforms**: Payment/collection signatures are more readable
- **Exams**: Result recording signatures show teacher names
- **PDFs**: All PDF signatures display proper names
- **Procurement**: Purchase records show clear staff names

## Testing
1. Make a fee payment
2. Check the payment history section
3. You should now see: "Collected by [Full Name] ‚Ä¢ [Date]"
4. Visit `/test-signatures` to see examples

## Notes
- This change applies to all NEW signatures created after the fix
- Existing signatures in the database will still show the old format
- The change is backward compatible - if full names aren't available, it falls back to username
