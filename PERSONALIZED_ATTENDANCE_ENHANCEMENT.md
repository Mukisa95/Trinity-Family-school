# Personalized Attendance Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the parent attendance dashboard with personalized, friendly messages and improved user experience for daily, weekly, and monthly attendance viewing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Personalized Attendance Messages** ðŸ‘¤
Instead of generic headings, the system now shows personalized messages like:
- **Present**: "Jovan was present today"
- **Late**: "Jovan came late today" 
- **Absent**: "Jovan did not come to school today"
- **Excused**: "Jovan was given permission to skip school today"
- **Excluded Day**: "Jovan does not have to come to school on Sunday, August 17, 2025 because it is: a Sunday"
- **Missing Record**: "today's attendance record was not taken so contact the school for more information"

### 2. **Smart Excluded Day Detection** ðŸ“…
The system automatically detects and explains why a child doesn't need to attend school:
- **Weekends**: "a Sunday" or "a Saturday"
- **Holidays**: Uses the description from excluded days (e.g., "New Year's Day", "Labour Day")
- **Non-school Days**: "a non-school day"
- **Regular Days**: "a regular school day"

### 3. **Friendly Remark Interface** ðŸ’¬
- **Dialog Title**: "Please, tell us why" (instead of "Add Attendance Remark")
- **Personalized Context**: "Help us understand why Jovan was late on this day"
- **Friendly Label**: "Please, tell us why" (instead of "Remarks")
- **Better Placeholder**: "e.g., Sick, Doctor appointment, Family emergency, etc."

### 4. **Enhanced View Modes** ðŸŽ¯
- **Daily View**: Personalized message card with no generic heading
- **Weekly View**: Shows all 7 days of the week with personalized messages for each day
- **Monthly View**: Shows all days of the month with personalized messages for each day
- **Yearly/Term View**: Traditional list view for longer periods

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Personalized Message Generation
```typescript
const getPersonalizedMessage = (record: AttendanceRecord | null, date: string) => {
  const firstName = pupil?.firstName || 'Your child';
  const selectedDate = new Date(date);
  const isSelectedDateToday = isToday(selectedDate);
  const dateText = isSelectedDateToday ? 'today' : `on ${format(selectedDate, 'EEEE, MMMM dd, yyyy')}`;
  
  // Check if it's an excluded day (weekend, holiday, etc.)
  const excludedDayReason = getExcludedDayReason(selectedDate);
  const isExcludedDay = excludedDayReason !== 'a regular school day';
  
  if (!record) {
    if (isExcludedDay) {
      // It's an excluded day, so child doesn't need to come to school
      return `${firstName} does not have to come to school ${dateText} because it is: ${excludedDayReason}`;
    } else {
      // It's a school day but no attendance record was taken
      const recordText = isSelectedDateToday ? "today's attendance record" : 
                        isToday(new Date(selectedDate.getTime() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)) ? "yesterday's attendance record" :
                        `the record of ${format(selectedDate, 'MMMM dd')}`;
      return `${recordText} was not taken so contact the school for more information.`;
    }
  }
  
  switch (record.status) {
    case 'Present': return `${firstName} was present ${dateText}`;
    case 'Late': return `${firstName} came late ${dateText}`;
    case 'Absent': return `${firstName} did not come to school ${dateText}`;
    case 'Excused': return `${firstName} was given permission to skip school ${dateText}`;
    default: return `${firstName}'s attendance for ${dateText}`;
  }
};
```

### Period Day Generation
```typescript
const getDaysInPeriod = () => {
  if (viewMode === 'weekly' && selectedWeek) {
    const weekStart = new Date(selectedWeek);
    const weekEnd = endOfWeek(weekStart, { weekStartsOn: 1 });
    const days = [];
    let currentDate = new Date(weekStart);
    
    while (currentDate <= weekEnd) {
      days.push(new Date(currentDate));
      currentDate.setDate(currentDate.getDate() + 1);
    }
    return days;
  }
  
  if (viewMode === 'monthly' && selectedMonth) {
    const [year, month] = selectedMonth.split('-');
    const monthStart = new Date(parseInt(year), parseInt(month) - 1, 1);
    const monthEnd = endOfMonth(monthStart);
    const days = [];
    let currentDate = new Date(monthStart);
    
    while (currentDate <= monthEnd) {
      days.push(new Date(currentDate));
      currentDate.setDate(currentDate.getDate() + 1);
    }
    return days;
  }
  
  return [];
};
```

### Excluded Day Detection
```typescript
const getExcludedDayReason = (date: Date) => {
  const dayOfWeek = getDay(date);
  const dateString = format(date, 'yyyy-MM-dd');
  
  // Check if it's a weekend
  if (dayOfWeek === 0 || dayOfWeek === 6) {
    return dayOfWeek === 0 ? 'a Sunday' : 'a Saturday';
  }
  
  // Check if it's in excluded days (specific dates)
  const excludedDay = excludedDays.find(day => 
    day.type === 'specific_date' && day.date === dateString
  );
  if (excludedDay) {
    return excludedDay.description || 'a holiday';
  }
  
  // Check if it's in excluded days (recurring days of week)
  const recurringExcludedDay = excludedDays.find(day => 
    day.type === 'recurring_day_of_week' && day.dayOfWeek === dayOfWeek
  );
  if (recurringExcludedDay) {
    return recurringExcludedDay.description || 'a non-school day';
  }
  
  // Check if it's a school day
  if (!isSchoolDay(date, currentAcademicYear || null, excludedDays)) {
    return 'a non-school day';
  }
  
  return 'a regular school day';
};
```
