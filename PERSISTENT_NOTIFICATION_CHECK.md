# 🔔 Persistent Notification Permission Check

## ✅ What Changed

The notification permission prompt now **checks on EVERY visit and navigation** instead of just once every 7 days.

---

## 🎯 New Behavior

### **Before (Old):**
- Showed prompt once
- If user clicked "Later", waited 7 days before showing again
- Used localStorage to track if user was asked

### **After (New):**
- ✅ **Checks on EVERY page load**
- ✅ **Checks on EVERY navigation** (route change)
- ✅ **Shows prompt immediately** if permission not granted
- ✅ **Persistent reminder** until user enables or denies

---

## 📊 How It Works Now

### **Scenario 1: Permission Not Granted (default)**
```
User visits app → Check permission (default)
        ↓
Wait 3 seconds
        ↓
Show notification prompt ✅
        ↓
User clicks "Later"
        ↓
Prompt dismissed
        ↓
User navigates to another page
        ↓
Check permission again (still default)
        ↓
Show prompt again ✅ (persistent!)
```

### **Scenario 2: Permission Granted**
```
User visits app → Check permission (granted)
        ↓
No prompt shown ✅
        ↓
Auto-register service worker ✅
        ↓
User navigates to another page
        ↓
Check permission again (granted)
        ↓
Still no prompt ✅
```

### **Scenario 3: Permission Denied**
```
User visits app → Check permission (denied)
        ↓
No prompt shown ✅ (respecting user choice)
        ↓
User navigates to another page
        ↓
Check permission again (denied)
        ↓
Still no prompt ✅ (respecting choice)
```

## 🔄 Triggers for Checking Permission

The app now checks notification permission in these situations:

1. **On page load** (initial visit)
2. **On every route navigation** (when user clicks links)
3. **When user state changes** (login/logout)

This is achieved by:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Check notification permission
  const currentPermission = Notification.permission;
  
  if (currentPermission === 'default') {
    // Show prompt after 3 seconds
    setTimeout(() => setShowPrompt(true), 3000);
  }
}, [user, pathname]); // Re-run on user or route change
```

## 🎨 Visual Changes

### **Updated Message:**
```
Old: "You can change this later in your browser settings"
New: "This prompt will appear on each visit until enabled"
```

This makes it clear to users that the prompt is persistent.

## 🧠 Technical Details

### **What Was Removed:**
- ❌ localStorage tracking (`notification-permission-asked`)
- ❌ localStorage timestamp (`notification-permission-asked-time`)
- ❌ 7-day cooldown logic
- ❌ "hasAskedBefore" check

### **What Was Added:**
- ✅ `pathname` dependency in useEffect
- ✅ Check on every navigation
- ✅ Better logging for debugging
- ✅ Auto service worker registration on granted permission

### **What Was Kept:**
- ✅ 3-second delay before showing prompt
- ✅ Beautiful animated UI
- ✅ "Enable" and "Later" buttons
- ✅ Respects explicit "denied" permission

## 📝 Permission States Explained

| Permission State | What It Means | App Behavior |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **`default`** | User hasn't decided yet | ✅ **Show prompt on every visit** |
| **`granted`** | User enabled notifications | ✅ No prompt, auto-register SW |
| **`denied`** | User explicitly blocked | ✅ No prompt, respect choice |

---

## 🧪 Testing the Changes

### **Test 1: First Visit (Permission Default)**
1. Open app in incognito/private window
2. Log in
3. Wait 3 seconds → **Prompt appears** ✅
4. Click "Later"
5. Navigate to another page (e.g., Pupils)
6. Wait 3 seconds → **Prompt appears again** ✅ (This is the key change!)

### **Test 2: Permission Already Granted**
1. Enable notifications (grant permission)
2. Navigate to different pages
3. **No prompts appear** ✅
4. Check console: "Service worker ensured" message ✅

### **Test 3: Permission Denied**
1. Explicitly deny notification permission
2. Navigate to different pages
3. **No prompts appear** ✅
4. Check console: "Permission explicitly denied, respecting choice" ✅

---

## 🔍 Console Logging

The app now provides detailed logging for debugging:

```javascript
// When checking permission
[Auto Notification] Current permission status: default

// When showing prompt
[Auto Notification] Permission not granted, will show prompt after delay
[Auto Notification] Showing notification permission prompt

// When permission granted
✅ Notification permission granted
✅ Service worker ready for push notifications

// When permission denied
⚠️ Notification permission denied by user

// When user dismisses
[Auto Notification] User dismissed prompt, will show again on next visit
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### **For Users:**
- ✅ **Consistent reminders** - Won't forget to enable notifications
- ✅ **Clear messaging** - Knows prompt will keep appearing
- ✅ **Easy to enable** - Prompt always accessible
- ✅ **Respectful** - Can permanently deny if desired

### **For School:**
- ✅ **Higher opt-in rate** - More users will eventually enable
- ✅ **Better communication** - More users reachable via notifications
- ✅ **Improved engagement** - Users stay connected
- ✅ **Less friction** - No need to find notifications page

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Permission Persistence:**
- Once user grants permission, prompt **never appears again** ✅
- Once user denies permission, prompt **never appears again** ✅
- Only if permission is "default", prompt **keeps appearing** ✅

### **Browser Native Denial:**
If user clicks "Block" on the native browser permission dialog 3+ times, the browser may permanently block permission requests. At that point, the user must manually enable notifications in browser settings.

## 📊 Expected User Journey

### **Day 1:**
1. User logs in → Prompt appears
2. User clicks "Later" (not ready yet)
3. User navigates around → Prompt keeps appearing
4. User gets used to seeing it

### **Day 2:**
1. User logs in again → Prompt appears (reminder)
2. User decides to enable it ✅
3. Notifications granted!
4. Prompt never appears again ✅

### **Result:**
More users enable notifications because of consistent, gentle reminders!
