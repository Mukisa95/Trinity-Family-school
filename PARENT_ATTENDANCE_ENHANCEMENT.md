```

### Current Term Detection
```typescript
const currentTerm = useMemo(() => {
  if (!currentAcademicYear) return null;
  
  const now = new Date();
  
  // Find term that contains current date
  const termByDate = currentAcademicYear.terms.find(term => {
    if (!term.startDate || !term.endDate) return false;
    const termStart = new Date(term.startDate);
    const termEnd = new Date(term.endDate);
    return now >= termStart && now <= termEnd;
  });
  
  return termByDate || currentAcademicYear.terms[0] || null;
}, [currentAcademicYear]);
```

### Enhanced Filtering
```typescript
const filteredRecords = useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = attendanceRecords;
  
  // Filter by academic year
  if (effectiveAcademicYearId) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(record => record.academicYearId === effectiveAcademicYearId);
  }
  
  // Filter by term if term view is selected
  if (viewMode === 'term' && effectiveTermId) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(record => record.termId === effectiveTermId);
  }
  
  return filtered;
}, [attendanceRecords, effectiveAcademicYearId, effectiveTermId, viewMode]);
