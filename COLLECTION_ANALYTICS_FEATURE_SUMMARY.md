## üîß Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
1. User navigates to /fees/analytics
   ‚Üì
2. useCollectionAnalytics hook triggers
   ‚Üì
3. Batch loads data in parallel:
   - Pupils (getActivePupils)
   - Payments (getAllPaymentsByTerm)
   - Fee Structures (getByTermAndYear)
   - Classes (getAll)
   ‚Üì
4. CollectionAnalyticsService processes:
   - Creates lookup Maps
   - Calculates overview stats
   - Calculates time-based stats
   - Calculates class breakdown
   - Calculates trends
   ‚Üì
5. React Query caches result
   ‚Üì
6. Components render with animations
   ‚Üì
7. User sees beautiful dashboard in < 2 seconds!
```

### Key Optimizations

**1. Parallel Data Loading**:
```typescript
const [pupils, payments, feeStructures, classes] = await Promise.all([
  PupilsService.getActivePupils(),
  PaymentsService.getAllPaymentsByTerm(yearId, termId),
  FeeStructuresService.getByTermAndYear(termId, yearId),
  ClassesService.getAll()
]);
```

**2. Map-Based Lookups** (O(1) instead of O(N)):
```typescript
const classesMap = new Map(classes.map(c => [c.id, c]));
const paymentsByPupil = PaymentsService.groupPaymentsByPupil(payments);
```

**3. Single-Pass Calculations**:
```typescript
for (const pupil of pupils) {
  // Calculate everything in one loop
  const expected = calculatePupilExpectedFees(pupil);
  const collected = paymentsByPupil.get(pupil.id);
  // Update totals, categorize, all in one pass
}
```
