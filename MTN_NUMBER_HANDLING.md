# MTN Number Handling by SMS Provider

## Overview

The bulk SMS system now dynamically handles MTN numbers (25677, 25678, 25674) based on the active SMS service provider. This ensures optimal delivery rates and cost management.

## Provider-Specific Behavior

### Africa's Talking (Default)
- **MTN Numbers**: ‚ùå **BLOCKED**
- **Reason**: Africa's Talking has known delivery issues with MTN Uganda numbers
- **Behavior**: MTN numbers are automatically filtered out before sending
- **User Notification**: Shows warning about blocked MTN numbers
- **Cost Impact**: No charges for blocked MTN numbers

### Wiza SMS
- **MTN Numbers**: ‚úÖ **ALLOWED**
- **Reason**: Wiza SMS has reliable delivery to MTN Uganda numbers
- **Behavior**: MTN numbers are included in the message send
- **User Notification**: Shows success message including MTN count
- **Cost Impact**: Normal charges apply for all numbers

## How It Works

### 1. Provider Detection
The system automatically detects the active SMS provider from the SMS settings:
- Checks localStorage for saved provider configuration
- Identifies the provider marked as "Active" and "Default"
- Falls back to Africa's Talking if no provider is configured

### 2. Dynamic MTN Filtering
```javascript
// Only block MTN numbers if using Africa's Talking
if (activeProvider === 'africas_talking' || activeProvider === 'Africa\'s Talking') {
  // Filter out MTN numbers (25677, 25678, 25674)
  mtnNumbers = recipients.filter(phone => {
    // MTN detection logic
    return localNumber.match(/^(77|78|76|39)/);
  });
  allowedNumbers = recipients.filter(phone => !mtnNumbers.includes(phone));
} else {
  // Allow all numbers for other providers (like Wiza SMS)
  allowedNumbers = recipients;
}
```

### 3. User Interface Updates
- **Blocked MTN Alert**: Shows when MTN numbers are blocked (Africa's Talking)
- **MTN Success Alert**: Shows when MTN numbers are successfully sent (Wiza SMS)
- **Provider-Specific Messages**: Different success/error messages based on provider
