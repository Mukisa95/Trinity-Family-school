# Uniform Tracking Integration with Fees Collection System

## Overview

This integration allows uniform tracking records to appear as fee items in the individual pupil fees collection page. When uniforms are assigned to a pupil, they automatically show up in the fees collection interface, can be paid through the same system, and maintain synchronization between both the uniform tracking and fees systems.

## Features

### üéØ **Seamless Integration**
- Uniform tracking records automatically appear as fee items
- No duplicate data entry required
- Real-time synchronization between systems

### üí∞ **Unified Payment Processing**
- Make payments for uniforms directly in the fees collection page
- Payments update both the fees system and uniform tracking
- Full payment history maintained in both systems

### üìä **Comprehensive Reporting**
- Uniform costs included in total fee calculations
- Balance carry-forward functionality
- Complete payment audit trail

### üè∑Ô∏è **Clear Identification**
- Uniform fees are clearly marked with a uniform icon
- Additional uniform details displayed (selection mode, items, discounts)
- Easy distinction from regular fees

## How It Works

### 1. **Uniform Assignment**
When a uniform is assigned to a pupil through the uniform tracking system:
- The assignment creates a tracking record
- This record is automatically converted into a fee structure
- The fee appears in the pupil's fees collection page

### 2. **Fee Display**
Uniform fees are displayed with:
- üëï Uniform indicator badge
- Selection mode (Full Set, Partial, Single Item)
- List of uniform items included
- Applied discounts (if any)
- Current payment status

### 3. **Payment Processing**
When a payment is made for a uniform fee:
- Payment is recorded in the fees system
- Uniform tracking record is updated automatically
- Payment status is synchronized across both systems
- History is maintained in both locations

### 4. **Balance Management**
- Outstanding uniform balances are carried forward
- Partial payments are tracked accurately
- Full payment automatically updates collection status

## Usage Examples

### For Administrators

#### Viewing Uniform Fees
1. Navigate to **Fees Collection**
2. Select a pupil
3. Uniform fees appear automatically with üëï indicator
4. View uniform details in the expanded section

2. Enter payment amount
3. Payment updates both systems automatically
4. View updated status in both Fees and Uniform Tracking

### For System Integration

#### Checking if a Fee is Uniform-Related
```typescript
import { UniformFeesIntegrationService } from '@/lib/services/uniform-fees-integration.service';

if (UniformFeesIntegrationService.isUniformFee(fee)) {
  // Handle as uniform fee
  const trackingId = UniformFeesIntegrationService.getUniformTrackingId(fee);
}
```

#### Creating Uniform Payments
```typescript
import { useCreateUniformPayment } from '@/lib/hooks/use-uniform-fees-integration';

const createPayment = useCreateUniformPayment();

await createPayment.mutateAsync({
  uniformFee,
  paymentAmount: 50000,
  pupilId: 'pupil-123',
  academicYearId: 'year-2024',
  termId: 'term-1',
  paidBy: { id: 'user-1', name: 'John Doe', role: 'admin' }
});
```
