# Exam Scheduling Form Improvements

## Overview
The exam scheduling form has been enhanced to automatically detect and use the current academic year and term based on the current date, ensuring accurate historical tracking and preventing manual errors.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Automatic Academic Context Detection
- **New Function**: `detectCurrentAcademicContext()` - Intelligently detects the current academic year and term based on the current date
- **Logic**: 
  - First tries to find the academic year and term that contains the current date
  - If current date falls within an academic year but not in any term (holiday period), finds the next upcoming term
  - Falls back to active academic year or first non-locked year if needed
  - Skips locked academic years to prevent scheduling in past years

### 2. Removed Manual Selection Fields
- **Before**: Users could manually select academic year and term from dropdown menus
- **After**: Academic year and term are automatically detected and displayed as read-only information
- **Benefit**: Eliminates possibility of human error in selecting wrong academic context

### 3. Enhanced UI for Academic Context
- **Auto-detected Context**: Blue-themed display showing automatically detected academic year, term, and creation date
- **Historical Record**: Amber-themed display when editing existing exams to show preserved historical context
- **Visual Indicators**: Badges showing "Active" academic years and "Current" terms
- **Clear Messaging**: Explanatory notes about why the context cannot be modified

### 4. Creation Date Tracking
- **New Field**: `creationDate` - Automatically set to current date when form opens
- **Display**: Shows creation date in the academic context section
- **Purpose**: Provides clear audit trail of when exams were scheduled

### 5. Historical Accuracy for Edits
- **Behavior**: When editing existing exams, their original academic context is preserved
- **UI**: Different styling (amber theme) to indicate historical record
- **Messaging**: Clear explanation that context is preserved for historical accuracy

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Auto-detected academic context (not editable by user)
const [academicYearId, setAcademicYearId] = React.useState<string | undefined>(undefined);
const [termId, setTermId] = React.useState<string | undefined>(undefined);
const [creationDate] = React.useState<string>(format(new Date(), "yyyy-MM-dd"));
```

### Detection Logic
- Uses `isWithinInterval` from date-fns to check if current date falls within academic year/term boundaries
- Prioritizes current term, then upcoming terms, then defaults
- Handles edge cases like holiday periods between terms

### Form Reset Behavior
- Academic year and term are NOT reset when form is cleared
- They remain as detected by the system
- Only exam-specific fields are reset

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Eliminates human error in academic context selection
2. **Consistency**: All exams are automatically assigned to correct academic period
3. **Historical Integrity**: Existing exams maintain their original context
4. **User Experience**: Simplified form with fewer fields to manage
5. **Audit Trail**: Clear creation date tracking for all exams

## User Experience

### Creating New Exams
1. Form opens with automatically detected academic year and term
2. Creation date is set to current date
3. Blue-themed academic context section shows auto-detected values
4. Users focus on exam details rather than administrative context

### Editing Existing Exams
1. Form preserves original academic context from exam creation
2. Amber-themed academic context section indicates historical record
3. Original creation date is displayed
4. Context cannot be modified to maintain historical accuracy

## Future Considerations

- Could add admin override capability for special cases
- Might extend to detect academic year transitions automatically
- Could add validation warnings for scheduling exams too far in advance
