# Immediate Fix for 2025 Snapshot System

## **🚨 URGENT: Check Active Academic Year**

**Right now, go to your application and:**

1. **Navigate to `/academic-years`**
2. **Look for which year has the "Active" badge**

### **Scenario A: 2024 is still active (WRONG)**
If 2024 shows "Active":
```
🔴 CRITICAL PROBLEM: System is 6+ months behind!
✅ SOLUTION: Set 2025 as active immediately
```

**How to fix:**
1. Find the 2025 academic year card
2. Look for an "Set as Active" button or similar
3. Click to make 2025 active
4. Verify 2024 becomes "Past" or "Locked"

### **Scenario B: 2025 is active (CORRECT)**
If 2025 shows "Active":
```
✅ Academic year is correct
🔍 Problem is missing snapshots for ended terms
```

## **🔍 Quick Diagnostic**

**Open browser console (F12) and paste this:**

```javascript
// Quick system diagnostic
const now = new Date();
console.log('🕐 Current Date:', now.toISOString().split('T')[0]);
console.log('📅 Current Year:', now.getFullYear());

// Check if on academic years page - look for active year
const activeYearCard = document.querySelector('[class*="bg-green"], [class*="border-green"]');
if (activeYearCard) {
  const yearText = activeYearCard.querySelector('h2, h3, [class*="font-bold"]')?.textContent;
  console.log('🎯 Active Year in UI:', yearText);
}
```

## **📊 Expected Results for June 2025:**

### **2024 Academic Year:**
- **Status**: Past/Locked ✅
- **All Terms**: Ended ✅
- **Snapshots**: Should exist for ALL pupils for ALL 3 terms ✅

### **2025 Academic Year:**
- **Status**: Active ✅
- **Term 1** (Feb-May 2025): ENDED ✅ → Should have snapshots
- **Term 2** (May-Aug 2025): CURRENT ✅ → Should NOT have snapshots  
- **Term 3** (Sep-Dec 2025): FUTURE ✅ → Should NOT have snapshots

## **🔧 Immediate Fix Steps**

### **Step 1: Fix Active Year (if needed)**
If 2024 is still active:
1. Set 2025 as active year
2. Lock 2024 year  
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify term detection works

### **Step 2: Check Snapshot Status**
1. Go to `/dev-tools/snapshots`
2. Click "Analyze Snapshots"
3. Look for missing snapshots for:
   - All 2024 terms
   - 2025 Term 1

### **Step 3: Create Missing Snapshots**
1. Click "Create Missing Snapshots"
2. Wait for completion
3. Verify snapshots were created for ended terms only

### **Step 4: Test Fee Processing**
1. Pick a pupil who changed classes between 2024 and 2025
2. Go to their fees page
3. Switch to:
   - **2024 Term 1**: Should show old class with 📸 icon
   - **2025 Term 1**: Should show 2025 class with 📸 icon  
   - **2025 Term 2**: Should show current class (no 📸)

## **🚨 Red Flags to Look For:**

### **Wrong Active Year:**
- 2024 still shows as "Active"
- Current term detection is wrong
- Fee structures are for wrong year

### **Missing Snapshots:**
- Dev tools shows 0 snapshots for 2024
- No snapshots for 2025 Term 1
- Virtual snapshots for ended terms

### **Wrong Term Status:**
- 2025 Term 1 shows as "Current" (should be "Past")
- 2025 Term 3 shows as "Current" (should be "Future")
- Term dates don't match current date

## **✅ Success Indicators:**

After the fix, you should see:
- **2025 is active** academic year
- **2025 Term 2 is current** term
- **Snapshots exist** for all ended terms
- **Fee processing** uses historical data for 2024 and 2025 Term 1
- **📸 icons** appear when showing historical class/section data

## **🆘 If Still Broken:**

If after fixing the active year and creating snapshots you still see the issue:

1. **Check the console** for error messages during fee loading
2. **Verify the snapshot service** is returning real vs virtual snapshots
3. **Test the term status detection** manually with our utility functions

The root cause is almost certainly that the system doesn't know we're in 2025, so it's not creating snapshots for terms that have actually ended!
